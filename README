rep_it is a macro recorder (program for recording and playing keyboard macros by hotkeys)

Prerequisites: Python 2.6 and PyWin32 must be installed, then you need to copy pyHook folder and pyHook.pth file to <PythonDir>\Lib\site-packages.

Macros are in macros.txt file and entered in two ways: either by editing the file manually or by using keyboard shortcuts:
1. Press ctrl+alt+F1
2. Press hotkeys to call the macro, for example alt+h
3. Press ctrl+alt+F1
4. Press the "body" of the macro, such as "Hello, world!"
5. Press ctrl+alt+F3.
As a result, the following macro definition will be added to macros.txt:

<Name>
<Shortcut>alt+h
<Events>" H e l l o , space w o r l d ! "

Tags <Name>, <Shortcut>, and <Events> are required in all macros. When editing macros.txt manually all keys except the letters are written in lowercase.

More complex example of a macro:
<Name>double quotes
<Shortcut>alt+2
<Events>sl en " " left rl

<Name>
<Comment>Called by sequece of two keys, executes 10 times
<Count>10
<Shortcut>a b
<Events>s1 double_quotes sleep 0.2 <r+>Abc<r-> D e f

<r+> - "raw" input mode, in which you can enter only displayed keys.
<r-> - "normal" mode (default), in which you can enter all keys, but with spaces between them.

The names of some keys:
context menu button - apps
backspace - back
caps lock - caps
escape - esc
insert - ins
num lock - num
digits on the numeric keypad - numpad0 .. numpad9
page down - pgdn
page up - pgup
pause/break - pause
print screen - prtsc
scroll lock - scroll
space bar - space
win key - win
arithmetic operations on the numeric keypad - add, sub, mul, div
point on the numeric keypad - decimal

Delay: sleep <N1> or s<N2>, where <N1> - number of seconds, <N2> - number of tenth of a second

en - switching to the Latin keyboard layout
ru - switching to the alternative (russian) keyboard layout
sl (save language) - saves the current language
rl (restore language) - restoration of the language, memorized by the last sl command
These commands use the alt+shift for switching the layout

Predefined shortcuts:
ctrl+alt+F1 is already covered.
ctrl+alt+F2 - the same as the ctrl+alt+F1, but shortcuts to call the macro appear as you type.
ctrl+alt+F4 - disables all the hot keys (standby mode).
ctrl+alt+F3 - in the macro recording mode finishes recording, in standby mode exits from it (sets keyboard shortcuts on), in normal mode rereads macros.txt.
ctrl+alt+e - opens macros.txt for editing.

In the body of a macro, you can use the name of another macro, in which the spaces replaced by underscores. Be careful with recursion!
Macros can be called either by the combination of keys (alt+t), or by their sequence (ctrl+x 7 alt+b).
When recording a macro, you can use the following key sequences:
pause <digit> . <digit>, or pause . <digit>
As a result, into the body of the macro will be added delay (in seconds): sleep <digit>.<digit>
